# NBA-Name-Height-Weight
Inspired by the NBA Height-Weight repo by @simonwarchol, including csv files for later years

The iPython script included can be used to write to a csv file named "data_scrape_text.csv" 

The script works by starting with a link to the per 36 stats for all players in the league. Then it finds all of the links to the individual player pages

From there, the script gathers data about player name, height (converted to inches), and weight (pounds)

Unfortunately I am not familiar with BeatifulSoup, so that's why the quality of my code is pretty terrible
